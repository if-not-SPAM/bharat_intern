# BharatIntern Projects For Machine Learning : House Price and Wine Quality Prediction

Welcome to the BharatIntern repository containing two insightful machine learning projects: House Price Prediction and Wine Quality Prediction. These projects showcase predictive modeling using carefully curated datasets sourced from Kaggle, and provide a valuable learning resource for those interested in data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques.

## Project Descriptions

### 1. House Price Prediction

Predicting house prices is a fundamental challenge in real estate. This project delves into the art of predicting housing prices based on various features such as location, size, and more. By employing linear regression techniques, we aim to create accurate models that can estimate house prices with a high degree of precision.

### 2. Wine Quality Prediction

Wine quality assessment is often a complex task that requires understanding the relationships between different chemical properties and the perceived quality of the wine. In this project, we explore the fascinating realm of wine quality prediction using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing a comprehensive set of wine characteristics, we aim to build models that can predict the quality of wines, helping enthusiasts and connoisseurs make informed decisions.

## Datasets

Both projects utilize datasets collected from Kaggle, a prominent platform for data science competitions and collaboration. The datasets used in these projects are well-preprocessed and relevant to the specific problem domains. The data exploration and preprocessing steps are thoroughly documented in the project notebooks, providing valuable insights into the process of transforming raw data into actionable information.

## Usage

Each project is contained within its own dedicated directory, complete with Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) that walk you through the entire process, from data loading and exploration to model building and evaluation. You can follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebooks to understand the methodologies used and reproduce the analyses on your own machine.

## Dependencies

To run the notebooks and experiment with the code, you'll need to have a Python environment set up with the necessary libraries and packages. We recommend using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts. You can install the required packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file in each project directory.
